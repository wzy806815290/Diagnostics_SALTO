This repository contains the code and selected results for the paper **“Event-type-based Multi-dimensional Diagnostics of Process Limitations in Hydrological Models”** (Wang et al.).

## Code

All code is stored in the `Code/` directory, including:

1. SALTO model calibration, regionalization, and simulation  
2. Calculation of timing and magnitude errors between observed and simulated streamflow  
3. Analysis scripts and plotting  

## Results

Results are stored in the `Out/` directory. Due to data size limitations, we only share results for one catchment as an example for the analysis.
